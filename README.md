## Environment Variables

This project requires certain environment variables to be set for full functionality. Fill in the values in your `.env.local` file.

* `DATABASE_URL`: Your database connection string (e.g., from MongoDB).
* `FINNHUB_API_KEY`: Your API key from [Finnhub](https://finnhub.io/) for stock data.
* `BETTER_AUTH_URL`: The base URL of your application. 
  - **Development**: Set to `http://localhost:3000` or leave empty (will use `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`)
  - **Production**: Set to your actual domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
* `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`: A secret key for Better Auth. You can generate one using `openssl rand -base64 32`.
* `NODEMAILER_EMAIL`: Your Gmail address for sending emails.
* `NODEMAILER_PASSWORD`: Your Gmail app password (not your regular password).

**Important: Production Configuration**

When deploying to production, make sure to:
1. Set `NODE_ENV=production`
2. Update `BETTER_AUTH_URL` to your production domain (e.g., `https://stocks-signalist.com`)
3. This ensures that email verification and password reset links use the correct domain

**Email Verification in Development:**

In development mode (`NODE_ENV=development`), email verification is **disabled** for easier testing:
- Users are automatically signed in after registration
- Verification URLs are logged to the console instead of being sent via email
- No need to configure email credentials for local development

In production, email verification is **required**:
- Users must verify their email before signing in
- Verification emails are sent via nodemailer (Gmail SMTP)
- Verification links expire after 24 hours

To test email verification in development, check your terminal console for the verification URL after signing up.
